What does `SIGHASH_SINGLE` do?
---
This signature type will sign all of the inputs and only 1 of the outputs (the corresponding one in terms of index). It implies you're ok with participating in a transaction with the given inputs, as long as _this_ much goes to _this_ address. The rest of the outputs, you don't care.
=====================










=====================
## 202.
There are 4 sighash "flags", yet 6 possible combinations of those flags. How does that work?
---
One of those sighash types (`SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY`) can be _combined_ with any of the other 3 if desired. That makes a total of 6.
=====================










=====================
## 203.
Bitcoin transactions use a flag(s) called a _sighash_ to specify exactly what part of the transaction data should be signed. How many of those sighash combinations are there?
---
6 in total.
=====================










=====================
## 204.
What is the most common default sighash type used in bitcoin wallets?
---
`SIGHASH_ALL`
=====================










=====================
## 205.
What does `SIGHASH_NONE` do?
---
It signs all of the inputs in a transaction and none of the outputs. It amounts to saying "this transaction can use my UTXO, but I don't mind where it goes". It's the equivalent of signing a blank cheque.
=====================










=====================
## 206.
What's different between the standard base 64 encoding and Bitcoin's base58 encoding?
---
Base58 is base64 with the `0`, `O`, `l`, `I`, `+`, and `/` characters removed.
